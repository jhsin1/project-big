# project-big

This program takes two Strings, representing a first and last name, and combines them to output the full name.
To install, just copy the repo from GitHub into JupyterLab. Then, you can open the .ipynb file and run the code from there by hitting the run button. When you get asked to input the parts of the name, input them.
Just clone the repo onto your machine and do whatever you want to the code. Fork it like any other repo. We will approve any pull requests as long as the changes follow the code of conduct.

We chose the code of conduct we did because it provides a harassment-free experience for users. It is important people feel comfortable, so this was a good code of conduct for us to use. Also, we chose Apache License 2.0 because we wanted to make sure people can modify the code as they wish. They can do basically anything, the only limitations are trademark use, liability, and warranty.
