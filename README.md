# project-big

This program takes two Strings, representing a first and last name, and combines them to output the full name.
To install, just copy the repo from GitHub into JupyterLab. Then, you can open the .ipynb file and run the code from there by hitting the run button. When you get asked to input the parts of the name, input them.
Just clone the repo onto your machine and do whatever you want to the code. Fork it like any other repo. We will approve any pull requests as long as the changes follow the code of conduct.
